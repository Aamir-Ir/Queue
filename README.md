How to complie the program: Run make and use the ./A4 command

Explanation of components: My code has 4 files with the expected features. My main takes in 5 base test cases then asks the user a few questions in the menu. Each of the options in the menu are functions I have made as per the requirments of the program. The first 4 options are in the queueFunctions file and the sort functions are in the miscFunctions.c file. I have also submitted a working makefile along side this readme.

Program limitations: My program has 3 laws which is in the function sortUsername where for some reason the id changes. Secondly when running the program not all malloc's are propely free. Finally the program is not as robust as I acan possibly make it.

Future Improvements: I would like to properly free the malloc's, make my program more error proof, and fix any unqiue problems with integers I had in the function for sortUsername.
